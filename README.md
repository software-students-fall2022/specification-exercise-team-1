## Stakeholders

### Helen Zhao (Chief Marketing Officer of Smart Women Security E-board member of Phi Chi Theta)
- Problems/Frustrations: 
  1. She wants to cohost some events with other clubs, but she always finds that other clubs have repetitive events scheduled in advance and they are not feasible.. 
- Goals/Needs: 
  1. She needs a platform that clubs can exchange information or resources such that they can better communicate with each other and keep everything updated.


### Lawrence Jiang (President of Aviation Club)
- Problems/Frustrations: 
  1. Currently, when he run the club, he has to use multiple application including NYU engage for checking attendance, facebook messenger to communicate with e-board members, and emails to communicate with different clubs for cooperation. It would be annoying for him to jump around among these apps and it's easy form him to miss some messages. 
  2. It's really hard to keep all the club members' information organized in one place. 
- Needs/Goals: 
  1. He want a application that contains all these functionality together and he also want the application easy to use. In other words, he want the application only has the most basic management functionality only. 
### Maria Bermudez (President of United Nation International Children's Emergency Fund)
- Problems/Frustrations:
  1. She always finds NYU Engage is hard to use, since it is not clearly labeled, everything is in different forms.
- Needs/Goals: 
  1. She finds a private channel for each event very helpful, since currently she is using a group chat for everything, and it is hard to go back and find the historical messenger.
  2. She also finds a place to post resources that can be shared will also be very useful, since currently the E-board members need to reach out to other clubsâ€™ E-board for resource sharing. This process can be long.
  3. She wants a function to keep track of how successful an event is, so that the E-board members can know what events to host again.
